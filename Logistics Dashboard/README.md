2. Map: View shipping costs according to the destination location

3. Trips by Vehicle Type: Analyze the distribution of trips by vehicle type (truck) to optimize fleet use.

4. Evolution of Shipping Costs: Monitor changes in shipping costs over time to adjust pricing strategies.

5. Total Trips, Weight and Cubic Meters: Evaluate transportation efficiency by analyzing the total number of trips, weight and cubic meters transported.
